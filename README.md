# Josias Rico Technical Writer

Welcome to profile! 

I am a technical writer, and I've worked in the aviation, education, and banking sector. Recently, I participated in projects related to Security and Compliance assurance. I am good at interacting with different audiences in classrooms and conferences. I've learned to prioritize work and to solve customer-focused problems. I am skilled at interacting with cross-functional teams, managers, and directors. I am looking to improve operative processes for increasing security and saving money and time.

I am passionate about:

* Traveling and photographing around the world and Mexico. 
* Eating while having a good time.

I believe the best way to drink whisky is:

1. Serve ice cubes in a glass.
1. Add whisky and sparkling water.
1. Enjoy.

My dogs are:

Name | Breed
------------ | -------------
Argento | Weimaraner
Steeler | German Sheperd
