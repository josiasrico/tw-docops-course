### About Josias Rico

I am a technical writer, and I've worked in the aviation, education, and banking sector. Recently, I participated in projects related to Security and Compliance assurance. I am good at interacting with different audiences in classrooms and conferences. I've learned to prioritize work and to solve customer-focused problems. I am skilled at interacting with cross-functional teams, managers, and directors. I am looking to improve operative processes for increasing security and saving money and time.
